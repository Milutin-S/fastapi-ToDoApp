# fastapi-ToDoApp
In this project, I'll show 7 advantages that FastAPI has over other alternatives, like an API built with Flask, and I'll do this WHILE building out a fun little ToDo app.

1. It's just plain Python!
    They made it easy because the syntax is just plane Python.

2. Built in Async
It uses ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface
) that handles requests asynchronously.
